This is my stochastic epidemic model with random walkers on a 2D grid.

The project is done in C++ with the main file being epidemic.cpp and the gnuplot scripts used for visualisation of the data are the .plt files included in this folder.

For the description of the project you can see the presentation here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a174aNgqwBhUInxwFlHyOmUFfjf8Dd85/
